# Feature Specification: React ToDo Application

**Feature Branch**: `001-react-todo`  
**Created**: 2025-09-05  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "React„Çí‰Ωø„Å£„ÅüToDo„Ç¢„Éó„É™„Çí‰Ωú„Çä„Åü„ÅÑ"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a user, I want to manage my daily tasks digitally so that I can track what needs to be done, mark completed items, and organize my work efficiently.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user on the main screen, **When** they enter a task description and submit, **Then** the task appears in the task list
2. **Given** a user viewing their task list, **When** they mark a task as complete, **Then** the task shows as completed visually
3. **Given** a user with completed tasks, **When** they choose to delete a task, **Then** the task is removed from the list
4. **Given** a user with existing tasks, **When** they edit a task description, **Then** the updated description is saved and displayed

### Edge Cases
- What happens when task description exceeds 100 characters?
- How does system handle attempt to add empty task?
- What happens when browser local storage is full or unavailable?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow users to create new tasks with a text description
- **FR-002**: System MUST display all tasks in a list format
- **FR-003**: Users MUST be able to mark tasks as complete or incomplete
- **FR-004**: System MUST persist task data using browser local storage
- **FR-005**: Users MUST be able to delete tasks from the list
- **FR-006**: Users MUST be able to edit existing task descriptions
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide visual distinction between completed and incomplete tasks
- **FR-008**: System MUST display tasks in descending order by creation date (newest first)
- **FR-009**: System MUST enforce a maximum task description length of 100 characters
- **FR-010**: System MUST operate as a single-user application without authentication

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Task**: Represents a single to-do item with description, completion status, and metadata (creation time, modification time)
- **Task List**: Collection of tasks stored locally in the browser for a single user
